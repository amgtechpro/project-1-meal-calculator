Meal-Calculator: A Python Terminal-Based Macronutrient Calculator for Better Nutritional Tracking
by AMG Tech

Health is always a priority, but with all the variety in our diets nowadays, understanding what we are consuming with every meal has never been more important. I designed this tool to help my family keep track of their macronutrient intake, particularly carbs, because of a family history of diabetes. This tool is a comprehensive meal calculator that tracks all three major macronutrients — proteins, fats, and carbs, along with the total calories consumed during a meal. It works in the terminal and is designed to help anyone who wants to get a better handle on their diet and nutrition, whether for medical reasons, fitness goals, or general well-being. *Please note that at this time, it is still very much a work in progress!

Code Overview: The heart of this meal calculator is a Python program that allows users to input food items and their macronutrient values, calculate the total macros for a meal, and save and load food data from various formats (JSON, CSV, and Pickle). The program is designed with user-friendliness in mind, offering a menu-driven interface that guides users through different functionalities, such as adding new foods, calculating meal macros, and loading and saving data. There is even a random healthy-eating quote picker for users to play with and get a motivational quote that will encourage them to continue to eat healthy!

One of the key features of this program is its flexibility in data storage. Users can choose to save and load their food data in different formats depending on their preference, which is particularly useful if the program is used across different environments. The program is also able to handle errors, such as issues loading the initial data, ensuring a smooth user experience.
